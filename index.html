              I am a four year college student. Two of those years were
              dedicated to Pennsylvania State University where I persued
              Electrical Engineering. However, after two years I realized my
              interest in the subject was lacking. I persued other interests at
              a community college called Reading Area Community College. It is
              there where my
              <span id="fire">passion for web development was ignited.</span> I
              majored in Computer Information Systems and Technology. I
              graduated with honors and my goal was clear. I wanted to be a Web
              Dev. I then enrolled at Full Stack Coding Bootcamp provided by the
              University of Pennsylvania.
